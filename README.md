# Keeping Track of Time: Abstract Clock

## Design Process
This clock is an artistic representation of a standard analog clock. Each hand represents a sub-division of time: hours, minutes, and seconds. I chose this design because I wanted to combine simplicity with a modern visualization.

## Implementation
- The clock uses the `hour()`, `minute()`, and `second()` functions from p5.js for real-time tracking.
- Hands are visualized using lines, and their lengths correspond to the significance of the time unit.

## Thoughtfulness
I ensured the design maintains a clean aesthetic while showcasing an appreciation for the concept of time.
